# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [imba-base-template](https://github.com/imba/imba-base-template).

It aims to be a generic proxy for api´s where you can inject api keys / authentication without exposing it to the requester. It uses dotenv to define it´s workings. 

1. Copy .env-example to .env and set the env vars to fit the api of choice

    `API_BASE`: The root url to proxy - for example `https://api.openweathermap.org`
    `API_KEYS`: A comma separated list of api keys.
    `API_AUTH_TYPE`: `query` / `bearer` / `header`
    `API_AUTH_KEY`: `appid`, `client_id`
    `PORT`: 3000

2. Copy example-pm2.json to pm2.json and set the fields to the values of choice.

3. To run:
    In dev: Run `imba -w server.imba`
    In prod: Run `pm2 start pm2.json` to start the api under pm2
